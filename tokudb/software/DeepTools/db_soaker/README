DB SOAKER

Given any MySQL database schema, I needed a way to intelligently generate random 
data and fill said database in a variety of ways to simulate a customers use case, 
for example we need to be able to control cardinality of certain columns, ranges 
of integers used per columns, rate of operations per table, size of random strings,
 foreign key relationships etc..

Once filled we can then test query performance against very large databases
filled in a variety of ways.

This tool can be used for purely loading data, performing several UPDATEs, SELECTS
or perhaps full CRUD on all tables to perform a stress test.  
I needed this mainly for testing our database engine, but others may find this 
useful for other things.  

The project is very lightweight with only 1 main php file (gen_data.php), a php 
config file and a bash script. The bash script will spawn and manage several 
gen_data instances in parallel if desired and throttle the number of parallel 
clients to suit our needs. 

The config file is what defines what is to be done to generate the random 
data / sql statements on and given tables.

the config file that is needed is basically a php file that defines 3 multidimensional arrays

meta_data -  which defines all of the table and column meta data information
fixed_data - which defines tables and columns that requires some potential fixed data
what_to_do - which defines for each table what you wish to randomly perform on said 
             tables, be it inserts, selects, updates, deletes, or replace, along 
             with a range of sleep time between operations.

Initially this config file can be a hassle to create so to help with that I also 
created a file called make_meta_data.php that will generate the config file based
on an existing mysql database.  Once generated you can then tweak the values to suit your needs.

It might also make sense to have a config for purely loading data into a database 
with a fixed size, and then use a separate config that would perform more selects, updates 
, deletes, etc with specified delays between events.. to simulate a customers steady state 
database usage.

Optionally, gen_data can also be used to generate tab delimited data files to be used for 
loading a database via infile load


gen_data.php  USAGE:

USAGE: ./bin/gen_data.php [OPTIONS] [TABLE] [ITERATIONS] [ACTION (insert or tab_del_dump)

ACTION: insert means we are connecting to a database and running sql commands directly, 
        tab_del_dump means we are not connecting to a database, we are just writing out tab 
        delimited data files for use later in an infile data load to a database.
 
ITERATIONS:  number of operations to perform on given table.
 
TABLE:   mysql table to perform actions on.
 
OPTIONS:
 -u USER
            mysql username to be used. current user is used if not specified. Used for insert action only.
 -p PASSWORD
            mysql password to be used. Used for insert action only.
 -h=HOST
            mysql host. Used for insert action only.
 --config=CONFIG
            php config file to be used. default is config.php in configs dir
 --database=DATABASE
            mysql database to use. Used for insert action only.
 --extended_insert_size=EXTENDED_INSERT_SIZE
            transaction size used for inserts and replace, using insert action (default is 100). 
            for tab_del_dump action this will denote the number of lines per file.
 --min_transaction_size=MIN_TRANSACTION_SIZE
            min transaction size used when randomly generating a transaction size.(default is 1, meaning no transactions occur.) 
 --max_transaction_size=MAX_TRANSACTION_SIZE
            max transaction size used when randomly generating a transaction size. (default is 1, meaning no transactions occur.) 
 --rollback_chance=x
           one out of x chance to rollback a transaction instead of commiting it. (default is 0, meaning never rollback) 
 --select_lock_in_share_mode_chance=x
           one out of x chance to add a LOCK IN SHARE MODE to a select statement. (default is 0, meaning never) 
 --seed=SEED
            integer used for autoinc offset.  Used for insert action only. Used when running several times in parallel to prevent collisions
 --output_dir=OUTPUT_DIR
            directory that tab delimited files are generated. Used for tab_del_dump action only. default is /tmp
 --write_sql_to_disk
            write all successful sql queries to files in ./sql_out . Used for insert only action.



example scripts.

to create and example schema and load it with random data run:
./example_database_1_loadup.sh [mysql_user] [mysql_pass] [mysql_host]

to run full crud (inserts, update, selects and deletes) on example database run:
./example_database_1_soak.sh [mysql_user] [mysql_pass] [mysql_host]
